            Subscription options available to the customer include a one-time
            purchase option, as well as 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month
            subscription options. The customer will receive the specified number
            of deliveries based on the subscription option they choose. The two

            subscriptions by contacting us directly. The cancellation will take
            effect when we have confirmed receipt of the customer&apos;s

            fulfilled for the duration of the period which has been paid. If the

            subscription to another recipient of the customer&apos;s choice.
